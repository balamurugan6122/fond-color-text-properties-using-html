    <h1>History of Tamil Language</h1>
    <h3 class="underline">History</h3>
    <p>Tamil, like other <span class="highlites">Dravidian languages</span> , ultimately descends from the Proto-Dravidian language, which was most likely spoken around the third millennium BC, possibly in the region around the lower Godavari river basin. The material evidence suggests that the speakers of Proto-Dravidian were of the culture associated with the Neolithic complexes of South India.[33]

        Among Indian languages, Tamil has the most ancient non-Sanskritic Indian literature.[34] Scholars categorise the attested history of the language into three periods: Old Tamil (300 BC–AD 700), Middle Tamil (700–1600) and Modern Tamil (1600–present).[35] In November 2007, an excavation at Quseir-al-Qadim revealed Egyptian pottery dating back to first century BC with ancient Tamil Brahmi inscriptions.[20] There are a number of apparent Tamil loanwords in Biblical Hebrew dating to before 500 BC, the oldest attestation of the language.[36] John Guy states that Tamil was the lingua franca for early maritime traders from India.[37]
        
        In 2004, a number of skeletons were found buried in earthenware urns in Adichanallur. Some of these urns contained writing in Tamil Brahmi script, and some contained skeletons of Tamil origin.[38]
        
        Between 2017 and 2018, 5,820 artifacts have been found in Keezhadi. These sent to Beta Analytic in Miami, Florida for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dating. One sample containing Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions was claimed to be dated to around 580 BC.[39][40]</p>
    <h3 class="underline">Etymology</h3>
    <p>The earliest extant Tamil literary works and their commentaries celebrate the <span class="highlites">Pandiyan Kings for the organization of long-termed Tamil Sangams</span> which researched, developed and made amendments in Tamil language. Even though the name of the language which was developed by these Tamil Sangams is mentioned as Tamil, the period when the name "Tamil" came to be applied to the language is unclear, as is the precise etymology of the name. The earliest attested use of the name is found in Tholkappiyam, which is dated as early as late 2nd century BC.[46][47] The Hathigumpha inscription, inscribed around a similar time period (150 BCE), by Kharavela, the Jain king of Kalinga, also refers to a Tamira Samghatta (Tamil confederacy)[48]

        The Samavayanga Sutra dated to the 3rd century BC contains a reference to a Tamil script named 'Damili'.[49]
        
        Southworth suggests that the name comes from tam-miḻ > tam-iḻ "self-speak", or "our own speech".[50] Kamil Zvelebil suggests an etymology of tam-iḻ, with tam meaning "self" or "one's self", and "-iḻ" having the connotation of "unfolding sound". Alternatively, he suggests a derivation of tamiḻ < tam-iḻ < *tav-iḻ < *tak-iḻ, meaning in origin "the proper process (of speaking)".[51] However, this is deemed unlikely by Southworth due to the contemporary use of the compound 'centamiḻ', which means refined speech in the earliest literature.[50]
        
        The Tamil Lexicon of University of Madras defines the word "Tamil" as "sweetness".[52] S. V. Subramanian suggests the meaning "sweet sound", from tam — "sweet" and il — "sound".[53]</p>
    <h3 class="underline">Old Tamil</h3>
    <p>Old Tamil is the period of <span class="highlites">Tamil language spanning the 3rd century BC to the 8th century AD</span> . The earliest records in Old Tamil are short inscriptions from 300 BC to 700 AD. These inscriptions are written in a variant of the Brahmi script called Tamil-Brahmi.[54] The earliest long text in Old Tamil is the Tolkāppiyam, an early work on Tamil grammar and poetics, whose oldest layers could be as old as the late 2nd century BC.[35][47] Many literary works in Old Tamil have also survived. These include a corpus of 2,381 poems collectively known as Sangam literature. These poems are usually dated to between the 1st century BC and 5th century AD.[35][47]</p>    
    <h3 class="underline">Modern Tamil</h3>
    <p>The Nannūl remains the <span class="highlites">normative grammar for modern literary Tamil</span> , which therefore continues to be based on Middle Tamil of the 13th century rather than on Modern Tamil.[59] Colloquial spoken Tamil, in contrast, shows a number of changes. The negative conjugation of verbs, for example, has fallen out of use in Modern Tamil[60] – instead, negation is expressed either morphologically or syntactically.[61] Modern spoken Tamil also shows a number of sound changes, in particular, a tendency to lower high vowels in initial and medial positions,[62] and the disappearance of vowels between plosives and between a plosive and rhotic.[63]

        Contact with European languages affected written and spoken Tamil. Changes in written Tamil include the use of European-style punctuation and the use of consonant clusters that were not permitted in Middle Tamil. The syntax of written Tamil has also changed, with the introduction of new aspectual auxiliaries and more complex sentence structures, and with the emergence of a more rigid word order that resembles the syntactic argument structure of English.[64] Simultaneously, a strong strain of linguistic purism emerged in the early 20th century, culminating in the Pure Tamil Movement which called for removal of all Sanskritic elements from Tamil.[65] It received some support from Dravidian parties.[66] This led to the replacement of a significant number of Sanskrit loanwords by Tamil equivalents, though many others remain.[67]</p>
